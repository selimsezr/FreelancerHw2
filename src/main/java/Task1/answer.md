# TASK 1

First of all, the task started by preparing a database. The database connection adjusted the flow of information in other classes accordingly. The common feature of all those who work hourly, regular and overtime hours is that they are employees. That&#39;s why an abstract working class was created that could collect the common characteristics of all of them. There are examples in the employee class that all employees can do in general. As an example, add or delete employees..

The operation of the program main class begins primarily with the login class. It then directs it to the employee class. If it works with a GUI, a key can be assigned to each property. Only if it works as a console output can it be run by enumerating transactions. For example, &quot;Add employees, press 1.&quot;

As the diagram shows, the login class primarily goes to the working class and is divided into sections from there. If we are on the console when defining an object, we will see &quot;1st Hour employee 2.Salaried employee 3. Overtime employee&quot;, and the user may be asked for a number input. Likewise, in the GUI design, a separate key can be given for all of them.

There are 4 columns in the database. These are the ones that are going to &quot;Name, Surname, Type, Salary&quot;. When adding a new employee, the user will be added to the 1st generation. And returns column 2 as input. 3. Sutun is asked to choose any of the 3 types, and the last column is 3. It is filled automatically depending on the selection in the column, but the user can change the last bra if they want to.

The 3 abstract methods specified in the upper class (employee class) are rearranged and written within the subclasses. In this way, the common methods for each class have been specially redesigned.
