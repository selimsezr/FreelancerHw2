# TASK 3

OOP logic was used in this task. In this way, it will be easy both to add new food and to the new airline. I first added a &quot;meal&quot; class to the project. Other airlines will be able to recognize this class by referencing it as an object. For example, we can consider the &quot;meal&quot; class as a library. Every airline wants to be able to use the food from that library for the kind it wants. In this way, ice cream can be used for both short flights and long flights as an example. In addition, when its features are improved (such as providing a database connection), the agency can easily see which airline gives the food the customer wants. Each new airline is creating its own class and taking an arraylist from the &quot;meal&quot; class within its class. It then organizes a food list for both short, medium and long flights. When an interface is designed, the first choice will be food, and then the airline will be selected. In this way, new airlines can be easily added to the system.
